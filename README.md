### NopeCHA Chrome Extension & Firefox Add-on

# Usage

To build for both Chrome and Firefox, simply run the following command:

`python export.py`

This will create `__debug__` and `__release__` directories in the project root directory, in which you will find `firefox` and `chrome` directories. Minified code for production can be found in the `__release__` directory.
